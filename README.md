Infinigen
=========
An open source voxel game engine



The following is the aim of the project:

Infinigen is a unique 3D OpenGL Java Game/Engine. The engine is based on Voxels and includes many advanced features. It takes many ideas and features from other games and combines them to create a perfectly scalable experience with the ability to be used as an FPS, MMO, RTS, RPG or Sandbox individually or all at the same time, allowing for some very interesting games to be made. It solves many problems present in most modern games, which critically undermine the experience for the player. For example De-Syncs in RTS games, where the general way of handling them it to instantly stop the game, instead Infinigen automatically detects and corrects any problems with the game state between players with no need to ever pause or exit the game.

There are absolutely 0 premade units. Players can build almost anything out of the prebuilt community made blocks and modules which are available from the steam workshop.

<h2>Ideas have been taken from these games:</h2>

<h3>Spring</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drawing on map</li>
<li>Adding points markers etc </li>
<li>Projectiles are all physics based</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rome Total war</h3>
<ul>
<li>Battle view</li>
<li>Time acceleration</li>
<li>Unit groups.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Civilization V</h3>
<ul>
<li>Empire view</li>
<li>Tech system</li>
</ul>
<h3>Europa Universalis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Advanced Diplomacy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Age of empires</h3>
<ul>
<li>Normal game screen</li>
</ul>
<h3>Minecraft</h3>
<ul>
<li>Real resources</li>
<li>Voxel Engine</li>
<li>Texture packs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Supreme commander 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ultra high unit counts</li>
<li>Animations for everything</li>
<li>Really nice graphics</li>
</ul>
<h3>Planetary annihilation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Client server re-joinable games, no desyncs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Robocraft</h3>

<ul>
<li>Voxel based units</li>
</ul>



<h2>Some more unique features have been included as well:</h2>


<ul>
<li>Physical constraint based vehicles and buildings (Things break when bent too far, etc)</li>

<li>Voxel Blurring (Makes the game look smoother in appearance)</li>

<li>Dynamic UI (The whole UI changes based on zoom level and which view you are in)</li>

<li>Unlimited thread usage (If your machine has 6000 cores it can use all of them)</li>

<li>Community made parts on steam workshop</li>

<li>No such thing as “Health” of a unit wherein the unit disappears when it hits 0 (If a shell hits a tank it simulates the explosion on the parts of the tank to give realistic damage)</li>

<li>User and official hosted servers (CloudServers)</li>

<li>Written in java and OpenGL to ensure best portability across all platforms.</li>

<li>Designed to run on even the slowest machine.</li>

<li>2D mode available, which doesn’t use OpenGL</li>

<li>Bullet Physics engine integrated</li>

<li>Improved A* pathing</li>

<li>All units powered by advanced AI techniques - work together to achieve a common goal</li>

<li>OpenAL audio</li>

<li>Map editor and real time fractal world generator for MMO games.</li>

<li>Support for community quests and campaigns (Make your own MMORPG).</li>
</ul>
